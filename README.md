# Dissertation

This repository is associated with Joshua Lee's dissertation. Steps to using this repository:

1. Clone the repository onto a folder on your desktop: git clone https://github.com/Starstorm/Dissertation
2. If you want to use the pre-trained model I developed, download it from https://www.dropbox.com/s/2yc1v93nyoagq5n/3_3_2019_acc_9751.hdf5?dl=0 and place it into the same folder as this Notebook.
2. Otherwise, go through the steps outlined in the Notebook to train your own model
3. Run the cells one-by-one in the Notebook, making sure to only run those cells that are relevant (i.e. don't run the cells to train a new CNN  if you're using the pre-trained model)
